# Readify — A Modern Book Discovery App

Readify is a **React + Tailwind CSS** web application that lets users discover, filter, sort, and read books fetched from the **Gutendex API** (Project Gutenberg).
It was developed as a **group project** to demonstrate our understanding of modern web development concepts such as React components, API fetching, context management, and responsive UI design.
